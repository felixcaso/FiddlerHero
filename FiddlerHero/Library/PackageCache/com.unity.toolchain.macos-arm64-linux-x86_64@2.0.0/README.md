# com.unity.toolchain.macos-arm64-linux-x86_64

This package provides a clang toolchain for building linux x86_64 players on a macos arm64 host. The llvm toolchain on the host is still darmwin x86_64, but the naming is changed. 
All toolchains need to be upgraded to the same latest version eventually.
 
This package is available as a pre-release package, so it is still in the process of becoming stable enough to release. The features and documentation in this package might change before it is ready for release.
